# Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a client to choose from a family of interchangeable algorithms at runtime. It encapsulates each algorithm and makes them interchangeable, enabling the client to vary the algorithm independently of the context that uses it.

## When to Use
- Use the Strategy Pattern when you want to define a class that will have one behavior that is similar to other behaviors in a list.
- When you need to use one of several behaviors dynamically.
- When you need to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms.
