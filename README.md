# Design Patterns in Python

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in Python. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They provide a structured approach to solving design problems, making code more maintainable, flexible, and understandable.

## Design Patterns

1. **Strategy Pattern**
   - [The Strategy Pattern](strategy_pattern/README.md) defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

2. **[Other Design Patterns]**
   - Coming soon...
